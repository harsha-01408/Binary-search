#number-theory

You are given two integers a, b. Find the number of integers i (i ≥ 1) for which i! is divisible by a but not divisible by b. If i! is divisible by both a and b, then you should not count that i.

Input
One line containing two integers a and b.

Output
Output a single line with the result.

Constraints
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^7

Example
Input:
2 3
