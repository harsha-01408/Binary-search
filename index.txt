FCDC - Factorial Modulo
#number-theory

You are given two integers a, b. Find the number of integers i (i ≥ 1) for which i! is divisible by a but not divisible by b. If i! is divisible by both a and b, then you should not count that i.

Input
One line containing two integers a and b.

Output
Output a single line with the result.

Constraints
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^7

Example
Input:
2 3

Output:
1

Explanation
2! is the only factorial which is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.

Problem: Determine Maximum Total Data Flow

You are given an array bandwidth of length n, where bandwidth[i] represents the bandwidth of the i-th processing node.

You also have an integer streamCount, which represents the exact number of data channels that must be opened.

Each data channel connects two (not necessarily distinct) nodes:
- One node is considered the main node.
- The other node is considered the secondary node.

Thus, each channel corresponds to an ordered pair of indices (i, j), where:
- 0 ≤ i, j < n

The data flow of a single channel (i, j) is defined as:
    bandwidth[i] + bandwidth[j]

Constraints:
- You may use each ordered pair (i, j) at most once.
- (i, j) and (j, i) are considered different pairs, and both may be used if desired.
- Pairs where i = j are also allowed.

Your task:
Choose exactly streamCount distinct ordered pairs (i, j) so that the sum of their data flows
    Σ (bandwidth[i] + bandwidth[j])
is as large as possible.

Return this maximum possible total data flow as a long integer.

Function signature (C++):
    long determineMaxDataFlow(vector<int> bandwidth, long streamCount);
